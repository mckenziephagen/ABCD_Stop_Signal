Analysis code used for "A cautionary note on stop-signal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] study" (Bisett, Hagen, and Poldrack, 2020). [Preprint] (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.084707v1)

clean_SST.ipynb takes in raw E-Prime SST data downloaded from the [ABCD Data Repository](https://nda.nih.gov/abcd) using [nda-tools](https://github.com/NDAR/nda-tools) python package, and creates one large data file (SST_concat_7321_all_rows_all_columns.csv) from participants who have 360 SST trials present. It also creates several additional columns that contain information of interest, like `correct_go_response`, which records whether or not the recorded go response was correct. 

SST_problems.ipynb walks through each issue identified in Bissett, Hagen, and Poldrack 2020, and generates the figures in the manuscript.
